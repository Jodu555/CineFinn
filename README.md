# CineFinn v2

This is the repository for my personal project CineFinn v2, a Movie Series / Anime Streaming Platform.
it is the successor to the CineFinn v1 Project which is now deprecated and will not be updated anymore.

## MVP Disclaimer
> The v1 Had a lot of Features that will greatly overpower the basic MVP
> I want to at first implement a basic MVP with only the most important features
> and then slowly add more features over time so that the v2 is a more complete version that has kind feature parity with the v1
> although the v2 has a complete database model overhaul and a completely reworked frontend so they cant be interchangeable used
> Technically all the MVP features are Server & Client side since I decided to rewrite both from scratch

### The Idea for the Transition Phase between v1 and v2

- The v1 site will be accessible under the normal domain!
- After I am comfortable with the v2 I will migrate the v1 site to the new domain
    - Comfortable means that the v2 has at least feature parity with the v1 and is stable enough
    - Until then the v2 site will be accessible using the normal domain suffixed with v2 (e.g. normaldomain.domain.com => normaldomainv2.domain.com)
